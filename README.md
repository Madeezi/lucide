# Madeezi's Lucide

This is a forked version of Lucide, to provide more custom icons on beyond of Lucide - an open-source icon library that provides 1000+ vector (svg) files for displaying icons and symbols in digital and non-digital projects. The library aims to make it easier for designers and developers to incorporate icons into their projects by providing several official [packages](https://lucide.dev/packages) to make it easier to use these icons in your project.
